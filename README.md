# MERN-STACK-ROADMAP 
The purpose of this repository is to provide a roadmap to perfecting the MERN stack, allowing one to confidently identify themselves as a full-stack software developer. [The Ultimate MERN Stack Guide](https://github.com/k-gqirana/MERN-STACK-ROADMAP/main/Mern-Guide.pdf) by [jsmastery.pro](https://www.jsmastery.pro/?discount=guide) is used as a foundation to identify fundamental concepts and is further elaborated by [Khanya Gqirana](https://khanya-dev.onrender.com/) to explain these concepts. Furthermore, coding projects will be provided from various sources to enhance understanding of these concepts.
